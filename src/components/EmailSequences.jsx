Hi [First Name],

Welcome to the [Your Brand] family! I'm thrilled you've joined our community of smart shoppers who want honest, detailed product reviews.

Here's what you can expect from me:

âœ… Unbiased product reviews (I test everything myself)
âœ… Exclusive deals and discounts (subscriber-only)
âœ… Weekly roundups of the best products I've found
âœ… No spam, ever - just valuable content

Over the next few days, I'll be sharing my top product recommendations that have genuinely improved my life. These aren't random picks - they're products I personally use and love.

Tomorrow, I'll send you my #1 productivity tool that saves me 2+ hours every day.

Talk soon,
[Your Name]

P.S. Hit reply and let me know what type of products you're most interested in learning about!`

          prompt: `Subject: The $47 gadget that changed my morning routine

Hi [First Name],

Yesterday I promised to share my #1 productivity tool. But first, let me tell you why I started reviewing products...

Three years ago, I was drowning in online reviews. 5-star ratings that seemed fake, sponsored content disguised as honest reviews, and products that looked amazing but fell apart after a week.

I was tired of wasting money on junk.

So I started testing products myself and sharing what actually worked. No fluff, no fake hype - just honest opinions from someone who's spent their own money.

Today's recommendation: [Product Name]

This little device has transformed my mornings. Here's why:

â€¢ [Benefit 1 with specific example]
â€¢ [Benefit 2 with specific example]  
â€¢ [Benefit 3 with specific example]

I've been using it for 8 months now, and it's still going strong.

The best part? It's only $47 on Amazon right now (normally $67).

[Check it out here: AFFILIATE LINK]

I'll be back tomorrow with another game-changer.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you grab this, let me know how it works for you!`

Hi [First Name],

I've been testing something for the past 3 months that I'm genuinely excited to share with you.

Without giving too much away, it's a [product category] that solves [main problem] in a way I've never seen before.

Here's what I can tell you:

ðŸ”¥ It's launching publicly next Tuesday
ðŸ”¥ Early bird pricing saves you 40% 
ðŸ”¥ Only 500 units available in the first batch
ðŸ”¥ I've negotiated an exclusive bonus for my subscribers

I'll have the full review ready Monday, but I wanted to give you a heads up because this will likely sell out fast.

Keep an eye on your inbox...
